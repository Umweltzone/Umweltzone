        "question" : "What is fine dust? What are fine particulates?",
        "answer" : "Fine particulates are nothing more than fine dust, in other words solid particles in the atmosphere smaller than 15 µm. Emission reduction targets in the European Union adhere to the guidelines laid down in the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) National Air Quality Standard for Particulate Matter (in short PM Standard), introduced in 1987. In the first draft of the American guideline the Standard PM10 was defined, which since 2005 has served as the threshold value in the European Union. Unlike the commonly cited definitions, PM10 is not a sharp definition of the emissions with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns, but rather an attempt to replicate the secretion behavior of the upper airways: particles with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 1 micron are fully included, a certain percentage of larger particles will be considered which will decrease with increasing particle size, and eventually reaches 0% at 15 microns. Technically, this corresponds to the application of a so-called weighting function (in specialist jargon a separating curve or separator function) on the emissions (in practice, this is achieved by a size-selective inlet to the measuring instruments) . From the shape of this weighting function the PM10 name is derived, because at 10 microns exactly half of the particles are taken into consideration in the weighting. Further information on particulate matter can be found at Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates)",

        "question" : "Why is dust harmful?",
        "answer" : "There are no harmless fine dust concentrations. For the population of the European Union an average reduction in life expectancy of one year results due to total particulate emission. The threshold limits defined by the EU ​​are more or less arbitrary and follow what is deemed politically feasible rather than what is regarded as scientifically relevant. Among the effects of fine particle pollution are, for example, an increase in the severity of allergy symptoms, a rise in asthma attacks, respiratory symptoms and lung cancer, as well as an increased risk of middle ear infections in children. In addition effects on the cardiovascular system (eg, myocardial infarct) are assumed. The extent of the impact of particles on the respiratory tract depends, in addition, to the toxicity of the particles, caused amongst others by lead, vanadium, beryllium, and mercury, and the size of the particles themselves: The smaller a particle, the deeper it can penetrate onto the lungs.",

        "question" : "How are environmental stickers allocated/assigned",
        "answer" : "Allocation of environmental protection stickers is regulated by law according to certain criteria. Diesel vehicles without particle filters, depending on the vehicles’ age, are allocated a red or yellow environment sticker. Newer vehicles with diesel particle filter are allocated for the most part a green sticker. Gasoline/petrol powered vehicles with regulated catalytic converters (G-Cat) are, without exception, assigned a green environmental sticker, which is why it can happen that very old vehicles can also obtain a green sticker. These are for the main part petrol engines with regulated catalytic converters.  Petrol powered vehicles without regulated catalytic converter are allocated either a green sticker or no sticker at all. So with petrol powered vehicles either a green sticker or no sticker is allocated. To check which environmental sticker your vehicle should be allocate, please consult the DEKRA internet page.",

If there are none specified there, then normally the standard exceptions plus other special cases apply. Visit your respective Office for Environment and Transport to obtain the most recent and accurate information. As a rule a form must be completed and additional evidence (such as a certificate of non-retrofitting or non-upgrade) provided in order to obtain an exemption for the specific  zone. Exemptions are usually time limited and do not always correspond to the validity of current  license plate details. Exemptions are usually valid from a few days up to a year.
